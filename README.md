# TF2 Unusual Effect IDs
A oneshot program for scraping TF2 effect IDs from optf2, which closes down on 8.10.2018.

You need not run this program (and, after 8th October 2018, it presumably won't work). Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/aleksamagicka/TF2UnusualEffectIDs/releases) and grab the resulting JSON file.

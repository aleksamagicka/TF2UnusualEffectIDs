# TF2 Unusual Effect IDs
A oneshot program for scraping TF2 effect IDs from [optf2](http://optf2.com), which closes down on 8.10.2018.

You need not run this program (and, after 8th October 2018, it presumably won't work). Instead, head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/aleksamagicka/TF2UnusualEffectIDs/releases) and grab the resulting JSON file.
